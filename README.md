#  Intro to AI A* Pathfinding Project
This is a senior project for the **COMP/EECE 4270 Intro to AI** Spring 2024 Course offered at the University of Memphis

## Description
Our group would like to implement an A* algorithm for pathfinding. The algorithm is 
a popular and efficient method for finding the shortest path between two points on a graph. 
Our proposed project aims to implement and optimize the A* algorithm covered in class to 
solve pathfinding problems efficiently. Our final outcome is to have a pathfinding AI 
(Artificial Intelligence) capable of finding the optimal paths in a graph with obstacles and 
varying terrain costs. 

## Objectives 
- Implement the A* algorithm with the Python programming language.  
- Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing the pathfinding process and 
results.  
- Optimize the A* algorithm for performance and memory efficiency.  
- Experiment with different heuristic functions to improve the algorithm's 
effectiveness in finding optimal paths.  
- Compare the performance of the A* algorithm with other pathfinding algorithms, 
such as depth-first search and breadth-first search. 

## Deliverables 
At the end of the project, our team will submit our GitHub code and produce a short 
PowerPoint presentation to submit online. We will cover the specifics of our 
implementation and conflicts during development. The presentation will include a video 
highlighting and comparing the pathfinding functionality to the other algorithms.
